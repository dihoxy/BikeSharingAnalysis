- Set up IDE environment in Pycharm, and PgAdmin(for postgreSQL)
- Created README and CHANGELOG files 
- Set version control system (VCS) to Git and created a repository in GitHub
- Connected VCS to Pycharm
- Changed README file from *"cleaning and basic EDA"* to *"inspecting fields and overall structure"*. The datasets are too large to filter and sort. This will be done in PostgreSQL
