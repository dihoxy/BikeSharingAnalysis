## Business Task 
*Analyze 16 months worth of bike sharing data to inform marketing strategy on the prospect of converting current "casual" riders into annual members over targeting new customers*
### Project Questions
- In order to do this, we need to understand how annual members differ from casual riders
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data
The 16 months worth of data live in 16 different csv files. All files have the same columns: ***ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual***
